Chef Ivo is an intuitive app that allows users to easily create a list of ingredients through an input form. Key features include:

Ingredient Addition: Users can add ingredients via a simple input form. Each entry is controlled to ensure no duplicate ingredients are added.

Ingredient Removal: Easily remove ingredients with a "Remove" button, allowing for quick adjustments to the list.

Recipe Suggestion: Once more than 3 ingredients are added, a new form will appear with an option to generate recipe suggestions.

AI-Powered Recipe Generation: When the user selects the option to generate a recipe, an API call to an AI service is made, which returns creative and personalized recipe suggestions based on the added ingredients.
